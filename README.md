# Time-Series-M4-Competition

This repository contains the implementation of benchmark forecasting methods from the M4 Forecasting Competition, conducted as part of an academic assignment.

The objective of this assignment was to implement statistical and machine learning benchmarks listed on page 57 of the M4 paper and compare the performance of these methods on time series from the dataset.

The following benchmark methods were implemented and evaluated:

* Naive 1: Last value method
* Naive 2: Drift method
* Naive S: Seasonal naive
* SES: Simple Exponential Smoothing
* Holt: Linear trend method
* Damped: Holtâ€™s method with damped trend
* Comb: Combination of forecasts (mean of selected methods)
* Theta: Theta model
* MLP: Multi-Layer Perceptron (neural network-based forecasting)
